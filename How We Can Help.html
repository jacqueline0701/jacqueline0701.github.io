Generally, we can stop marine pollution without ever leaving home. Much of the ocean pollution begins on land.
<BR>
Every year, 15 billion pounds of plastic are produced in the U.S, but only 1/15 of that is recycled. Much of the unrecycled plastic goes to the ocean.

1. Pick Up Litter
Whenever you see little, wherever it is, just pick it up and dispose of it properly. Make sure you sort out the garbage correctly.
<BR>
2. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (3R's)
Mostly every has heard of this phrase before, but mostly everyone do not follow this. Try to avoid merchandise with excessive packaging such as plastic and try to remember to bring a reusable bag to the grocery store every time you shop.
<BR>
3. Dispose of the Six-Pack Holder Correctly
When you purchase or find an un-used six-pack holder, make sure that you cut each and properly dispose of it. In the ocean, the rings will expand and can choke wildlife.
