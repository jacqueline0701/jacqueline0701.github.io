<H3>  Oil is dangerous to marine life. If fur-bearing mammals or birds get oil on their fur or feather, they may not fly or they may not move properly, maintain their own body temperature, or feed. When marine mammals try to clean themselves, they may ingest oil which could poison them. Oil clogs up the gills of the fish that live there and makes it really hard to breathe for them, suffocating them. When oil floats on the surface, it blocks sunlight and prevents marine plants from producing food using sunlights. Fishes might eat on the garbage because it looks like food, then bigger fishes might eat them, then humans would eat them. This causes the people who eat the contaminated fish to have illnesses like cancer and other long-term health problems.</H3></CENTER>

<H3>  Ocean mammals could get trapped in old nets and drown because they couldn't get to the surface for air. Sea turtles would think that floating plastic bags looks like a jellyfish, and would go eat them. The plastic bags would block their digestive system. When exposed to oil, adult fish may experience enlarged livers, changes in heart, reduced growth, or reproduction impairment. Oil also adversely affects eggs surviving. </H3></CENTER>

<H3> Plastic is the biggest killer of marine life. It takes on a avreage of 400 years for plastics to degrade in the ocean. Crude oil is the most dangerous and fastest cause of oceanic deterioration. Crude oil can suffocate marine life, causing disorientation and poisoning if ingested. Toxic metals also pour into the oceans from surface run-0ff. These metals can damage the behaviour of marine life. Plastics and plankton can absorb these toxic metals, and other animals might eat it. </H3></CENTER>
