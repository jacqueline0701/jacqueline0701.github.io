<H3> The ocean provides 70% of the oxygen we breathe and over 97% of the world's water supply. Everyday, the ocean is under attack from all the marine pollution and other sorts of pollution. Marine pollution does not only affect marine life and their environment, but would also affect us.  We as humans consume over 14% of our protein from fish.</H3></CENTER>

<H3> Chemicals  such as oil, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals could all be found within the ocean and it could contaminate water supplies and our food chain because it would affect the marine life involved. If humans are exposed to these chemicals that are toxic for long periods of time, this could result in a avery dangerous health problem or issue such as reproductive issues and damage to our nervous systems and kidneys. Mercury exposure can cause heart disease. </H3></CENTER>

<H3> Even though dumping of waste taks place hundreds of miles away from land, the trash could end up on the beaches or coastal areas and have a huge effect on the coral and wildlife. This build of the pollution on the beach could affect humans. Coming into contact or mistakenly ingesting the water could result in some side effects such as stomach-aches and skin rashes. Toxic metals like mercury would pour into oceans, and little small creatures would mistaken it as food and eat it. As the food chain continues, bigger fishes would end up getting caught and eaten by humans. Humans would then get sick because of that. </H3></CENTER>
